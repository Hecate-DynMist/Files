## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```text
git clone
```

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
